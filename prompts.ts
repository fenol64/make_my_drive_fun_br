3. Ensure the route is efficient and respects the allowed deviation in kilometers.
4. Present the route as a JSON object with the following structure:

{
  "distance": "total distance in km",
  "max_route_desviation": "actual deviation in km",
  "latitude": "latitude of the main route",
  "longitude": "longitude of the main route",
  "route_points": [
